What Web Application security mechanisms are involved in your topology? What security mechanisms would ideally be involved?

The defense mechanisms we will be implementing in our project would cover the following core components:

1 - Handling user access to the application’s data and functionality to prevent users from gaining unauthorized access, using:
Authentication.
Session management.

2 - Handling user input to the application’s functions to prevent malformed input from causing undesirable behavior, using:
Sanitization, almost always good if implemented right.
Reject Known Bad inputs as what WAFs do, has its advantages and disadvantages.

3 - Handling attackers to ensure that the application behaves appropriately when being directly targeted:
Handling errors, it should never return any system-generated messages or other debug information in its responses.
Maintaining audit logs, some key events should be logged. Events like, successful
and failed login, and change of password.



What testing framework did you choose and why?

The testing framework chosen is Python using Pytest.
