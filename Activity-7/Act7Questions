How would you fix your code so that this issue is no longer present?

We don't recommend sing calls that execute BASH nor any kind of language system call.We only recommend using specific methods like os.remove in Python or unlink($myFile) in PHP. We also recommend including input sanitization methods to prevent users from escaping input fields and injecting the backend.
