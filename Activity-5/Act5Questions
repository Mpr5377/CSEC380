How would you fix your code so that these issues were no longer present?
We recommend using Pymysql since it doesn't allow stacked command statements.

What are the limitations, if any that, of the SQL Injection issues youâ€™ve included?
The blind injection is blind; we cannot print the content of the database. The classical SQL injection is fully functional, we can exfiltrate all the data on the database.
