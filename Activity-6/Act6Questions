How would you fix your code so that this issue is no longer present?

One possible way to fix this vulnerability is not to use GET requests.

How does your test demonstrate SSRF as opposed to just accessing any old endpoint?

After requesting the 
http://10.1.1.1:5000/upload?linkupload=http://10.1.1.1/<name>.mp4
We can verify that it is actually functional by visiting; however, we need to make sure that <name> is a long random string, so that possibility of having an old endpoint is impossible:
http://10.1.1.1:5000/vids/<name>.mp4
