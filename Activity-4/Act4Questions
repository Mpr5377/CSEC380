How do you prevent XSS is this step when displaying the username of the user who uploaded the video?
We recommend using a sanitizer for every input the users add. Another recommendation would be using a Web Application Firewall. 

How do you ensure that users can’t delete videos that aren’t their own?
We basically use the current session username and match it against the username of the person that uploaded the original video, if succeeded, it will be deleted; if not, it will not be deleted.
